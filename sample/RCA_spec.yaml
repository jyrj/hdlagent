  - Module Name: RCA
  - The RCA module implements a simple ripple carry adder.
  
  - Input Ports:
  - a: 
  - Description: First 8-bit input operand.
  - Bit-width: 8 bits
  
  - b: 
  - Description: Second 8-bit input operand.
  - Bit-width: 8 bits
  
  - c: 
  - Description: Third 8-bit input operand.
  - Bit-width: 8 bits
  
  - Output Ports:
  - foo: 
  - Description: Output result of the addition.
  - Bit-width: 11 bits
  
  - Functionality:
  - The RCA module takes three 8-bit input operands (a, b, and c).
  - It performs an addition operation on these three operands.
  - The result of the addition is stored in an 11-bit output called foo.
  
  - Data Flow:
  - The input operands (a, b, and c) are processed by the RCA module.
  - A ripple carry adder algorithm is used to sum the operand values.
  - The calculation of the sum includes intermediate carry bits being propagated through the addition process.
  - The final result, which may extend up to 11 bits (including carry-out bits), is then assigned to the output foo.
  
  - Edge Cases and Considerations:
  - The module must handle cases where the sum exceeds the 8-bit operand limit, requiring the use of carry bits.
  - Ensure proper handling of carry overflow, resulting in an accurate 11-bit output.
  
  - Example Operation:
  - If a = 10101010, b = 11001100, and c = 00110011
  - The RCA performs the operation: \(a + b + c\)
  - Result stored in foo could potentially involve carry bits, ensuring the final output is 11 bits long.
