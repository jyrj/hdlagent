  - **Module Name: RCA (Ripple Carry Adder)**
  
  - **Inputs:**
  - `a` (8 bits)
  - `b` (8 bits)
  - `c` (1 bit of carry input)
  
  - **Output:**
  - `foo` (11 bits)
  
  - **Description:**
  - The RCA module is designed to add two 8-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and an additional 1-bit carry input (`c`).
  - The result of this addition is stored in an 11-bit output named `foo`.
  - The output `foo` accounts for the possibility of a carry-out from the most significant bit, which is why it contains 11 bits, even though the inputs are 8 bits each.
  
  - **Functionality:**
  - The Ripple Carry Adder works by processing each bit of the inputs `a` and `b` sequentially from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
  - At each bit position, the sum is computed using the corresponding bits from `a`, `b`, and the carry bit from the previous position.
  - The carry bit is propagated to the next higher bit position.
  - The 1-bit carry input `c` is added to the LSB of the inputs `a` and `b`.
  - The process continues until all bits have been processed and the final carry bit is computed, ensuring a full 11-bit result for `foo`.
  
  - **Constraints:**
  - The input values `a` and `b` should each be exactly 8 bits in length.
  - The carry input `c` should be a single bit.
  
  - **Behavioral Summary:**
  - If `a` and `b` are both 8-bit numbers and `c` is a 1-bit number, then the sum (`a + b + c`) is produced as an 11-bit number `foo`.
  - The 11-bit output ensures that all possible outcomes of the addition, including the carry-out from the MSB, are accurately represented.
  
  This formal specification provides a clear overview of the desired RCA module, detailing its inputs, output, functionality, and constraints.
