  - Design a module with the following specifications:
    - The module accepts two inputs:
      - Input 'a': an 8-bit signed integer.
      - Input 'b': an 8-bit signed integer.
    - The module provides two outputs:
      - Output 'div': a 6-bit truncated signed integer representing the result of division of 'a' by 'b'.
      - Output 'mod': a 6-bit truncated signed integer representing the result of the modulus operation of 'a' by 'b'.
    - The output 'div' should be calculated by performing an integer division of 'a' by 'b' and then truncating the result to fit 6 bits.
    - The output 'mod' should be calculated by performing a modulus operation on 'a' with respect to 'b' and then truncating the result to fit 6 bits.
    - All arithmetic operations are based on signed integers.
    - Truncation for fitting into 6 bits should preserve the sign of the result.
