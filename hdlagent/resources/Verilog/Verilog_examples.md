**User:** Write me a Verilog module named 'nor_reduction' that takes a 8-bit input 'bus_i' and has a 1-bit output 'reduce_o' which is the NOR reduction of 'bus_i'.

**Assistant:** ```
module nor_reduction(
    input [7:0] bus_i,  // 8-bit input
    output out          // 1-bit output
);

// NOR reduction of bus_i
assign out = ~|bus_i;  // Using reduction NOR operator

endmodule
```

**User:** Write me a Verilog module named 'odds_evens_sum' that takes a 7-bit input 'in_i' and has three outputs. 'odds_o' is 3-bits wide and is the odd-numbered bits from the input, concatenated in order. Conversely, 'evens_o' is 4-bits wide and is the even-numbered bits. The last output 'sum_o' is the 5-bit wide sum of 'odds_o' and 'evens_o'.

**Assistant:** ```
module odds_evens_sum(
    input [6:0] in_i,       // 7-bit input
    output [2:0] odds_o,    // 3-bit output for odd-indexed bits
    output [3:0] evens_o,   // 4-bit output for even-indexed bits
    output [4:0] sum_o      // 5-bit output for the sum of odds_o and evens_o
);

// Extract odd and even indexed bits
assign odds_o = {in_i[5], in_i[3], in_i[1]};  // Concatenate odd-indexed bits
assign evens_o = {in_i[6], in_i[4], in_i[2], in_i[0]}; // Concatenate even-indexed bits

// Calculate sum of odds_o and evens_o
wire [3:0] odds_extended = {1'b0, odds_o}; // Zero extend odds_o to match width of evens_o
assign sum_o = evens_o + odds_extended; // Summing evens_o and extended odds_o

endmodule
```

**User:** Write me a Verilog module named 'simple_alu' that implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit which has three inputs: 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i' are both 8-bit wide value inputs, and 'op_i' is a 2-bit wide opcode input, which determines the operation performed on 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i'. The function has a single 8-bit output 'result_o', which is set to the sum of the inputs when the opcode is 0, the difference of the inputs when the opcode is 1, and the product of the inputs when the opcode is 2. No other operations are supported, so if an unknown opcode is detected, the output is set to zero.

**Assistant:** ```
module simple_alu(
    input [7:0] rs1_i,
    input [7:0] rs2_i,
    input [1:0] op_i,
    output reg [7:0] result_o
);

// Define operation codes
localparam ADD = 2'b00;
localparam SUB = 2'b01;
localparam MUL = 2'b10;

always @(*) begin
    case (op_i)
        ADD: result_o = rs1_i + rs2_i;
        SUB: result_o = rs1_i - rs2_i;
        MUL: result_o = rs1_i * rs2_i;
        default: result_o = 8'b00000000; // Set result to zero if unknown opcode
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

**User:** Write me a Verilog module that uses a compile loop to add up the values from 7 to 11. The name should be 'add_7_to_11' and has 16-bit output 'res_o'

**Assistant:** ```
module add_7_to_11(
    output reg [15:0] res_o
);

integer i;

initial begin
    res_o = 0;
    for (i = 7; i <= 11; i = i + 1) begin
        res_o = res_o + i;
    end
end

endmodule
``` 

**User:** Write me a Verilog module that is a naive implementation of the RISC-V FMAdd instruction, where the opcode is as listed in the official spec, but any FP rules are ignored as well as the RM and FMT fields. The source operands will take on the values of their register numbers. The 'result' output will be the multiply-add operation, and the 'rd' output will be the decoded destination register. If the opcode is incorrect, then the 'err' output must be set and the other outputs must be cleared. The module declaration is 'module fmadd(input [31:0] instruction, output [4:0] rd, output [31:0] result, output err);'

**Assistant:** ```
module fmadd(
    input [31:0] instruction,
    output reg [4:0] rd,
    output reg [31:0] result,
    output reg err
);

// Decode fields from the instruction
wire [6:0] opcode = instruction[6:0];
wire [4:0] rs1 = instruction[19:15];
wire [4:0] rs2 = instruction[24:20];
wire [4:0] rs3 = instruction[31:27];

// FMAdd opcode
localparam FMADD_OPCODE = 7'b1000011;

always @(*) begin
    if (opcode == FMADD_OPCODE) begin
        rd = instruction[11:7]; // Destination register
        result = rs1 * rs2 + rs3; // Perform the multiplication-addition
        err = 1'b0;
    end else begin
        rd = 5'b00000;
        result = 32'b0;
        err = 1'b1; // Set error if opcode is incorrect
    end
end

endmodule
```

**User:** Write me a Verilog module that implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) simulating the game "green light, red light". The purpose of the game is to be in the 'GO_STATE' (state value 1) as soon as the 'GREEN_IN' signal (input value 1) is received, and to stay in that state until the 'RED_IN' signal (input value 0) is received. The state should then transition to 'STOP_STATE' (state value 0) and stay there until the 'GREEN_IN' signal is received again. The input to the class is the signal, and the output is the current state. The default/reset state should be 'STOP_STATE' and the reset is synchronous. The circuit has only one pipeline stage, meaning the result is updated on the next clock cycle. The module declaration is 'module stoplight_fsm (input clk, input rst, input signal_i, output state_o);'.

**Assistant:** ```
module stoplight_fsm (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input signal_i,  // 1 for green, 0 for red
    output reg state_o  // 1 for GO_STATE, 0 for STOP_STATE
);

// Define states
localparam STOP_STATE = 1'b0;
localparam GO_STATE = 1'b1;

// Define input handling constants
localparam RED_IN = 1'b0;
localparam GREEN_IN = 1'b1;

// State register
reg state_r;

// State transition logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        state_r <= STOP_STATE;
    end else begin
        case (state_r)
            STOP_STATE: begin
                if (signal_i == GREEN_IN)
                    state_r <= GO_STATE;
            end
            GO_STATE: begin
                if (signal_i == RED_IN)
                    state_r <= STOP_STATE;
            end
        endcase
    end
end

// Output logic
always @(*) begin
    state_o = state_r;
end

endmodule
```

**User:** Write me a Verilog module that is a 1 stage pipelined adder, this means the result should be updated within 1 clock cycle. The carry out bit should be preserved in the extended output. The reset should be asynchronous, and the reset value should be 0. The module declaration is 'module async_adder (input clk, input rst, input [1:0] a, input [1:0] b, output [2:0] result);'

**Assistant:** ```
module async_adder (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [1:0] a,
    input [1:0] b,
    output reg [2:0] result
);

// Temporary variable for the addition result
wire [2:0] add_result;

// Perform addition
assign add_result = a + b;

// Register to hold the result with asynchronous reset
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
        result <= 3'b000;  // Reset result to 0
    else
        result <= add_result;  // Update result with addition result
end

endmodule
```
