**User:** Nested Loops in Verilog:

1. Purpose: 
   - Nested loops are used in testbenches, hardware generation, and initializing structures in simulation.

2. Types of Loops:
   - For loop: Commonly used for a fixed number of iterations.
   - While and Repeat loops: Used for condition-based iterations.

3. Example Uses:
   - Generating Test Patterns: Applying a range of test vectors in testbenches.
   - Creating Hardware Structures: Such as logic gates matrices or connection networks.

4. Syntax:
   - Basic syntax: `for (initialization; condition; increment) { ... }`

5. Examples:

   - Simple Nested Loop Example:
     ```
     integer i, j;
     initial begin
       for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) begin
         for (j = 0; j < 5; j = j + 1) begin
           $display("i=%d, j=%d", i, j);
         end
       end
     end
     ```
     This prints pairs of `i` and `j`, iterating through a 10x5 grid.

   - Hardware Generation Example:
     ```
     genvar i, j;
     generate
       for (i = 0; i < N; i = i + 1) begin : row
         for (j = 0; j < M; j = j + 1) begin : col
           and gate_inst (out[i][j], a[i], b[j]);
         end
       end
     endgenerate
     ```
     Creates an NxM grid of AND gates with inputs `a[i]` and `b[j]`.
