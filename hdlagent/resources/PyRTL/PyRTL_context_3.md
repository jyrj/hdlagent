**User:** I have been writing some PyRTL code lately and I have come across a lot of syntax errors, let me show you what errors I have seen and how to avoid them.

***`Clock` signals should never be explicit in PyRTL
***Remove the explicit clock definition.
***Use the implicit clock for edge-triggered behavior.
***Adjust the reset logic to be synchronous with the implicit clock.
***To resolve this, we need to ensure that each register's `.next` property is assigned exactly once per cycle.
***Use a temporary wire to hold the next value before assigning it to the register. This ensures that the `.next` property is assigned only once, avoiding the error.

ERROR example1:
```
import pyrtl
# Define the input and output wires
clock = pyrtl.Input(bitwidth=1, name='clock')
~~~~~~~~
This is the compile warning/error:
    raise PyrtlError(\'Clock signals should never be explicit\')
pyrtl.pyrtlexceptions.PyrtlError: Clock signals should never be explicit
```
**In PyRTL, clock signals are implicit and are automatically handled by the system. Just remove the defenition of `Clock`

ERROR example2:
```
# Update logic
with pyrtl.conditional_assignment:
    with reset == 0:  # Asynchronous active-low reset
        counter_reg.next <<= 0
    with enable & (up_down == 1):  # Increment if enabled and up_down is high
        counter_reg.next <<= increment
    with enable & (up_down == 0):  # Decrement if enabled and up_down is low
        counter_reg.next <<= decrement
```
This is my error:
```
This is the compile warning/error:
  File "...", line 21, in <module>
    counter_reg.next <<= increment
  File ".../.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyrtl/wire.py", line 772, in next
    raise PyrtlError('error, .next value should be set once and only once')
pyrtl.pyrtlexceptions.PyrtlError: error, .next value should be set once and only once
```
Please help fix this issue by providing a diff.
Answer:
```
with pyrtl.conditional_assignment:
    with reset == 0:  # Asynchronous active-low reset
-       counter_reg.next <<= 0
+       next_value <<= 0
-   with enable & (up_down == 1):  # Increment if enabled and up_down is high
+   with enable:
+       with up_down:
-           counter_reg.next <<= increment
+           next_value <<= increment  # Increment if enabled and up_down is high
+       with pyrtl.otherwise:
-           counter_reg.next <<= decrement
+           next_value <<= decrement  # Decrement if enabled and up_down is low
+   with pyrtl.otherwise:
+       next_value <<= counter_reg  # Hold the current value if not enabled or reset

# Assign the next value to the counter register
-   # [No corresponding line in the original code]
+   counter_reg.next <<= next_value
```

Question: Can you fix the error by providing a diff?
Answer:
