**User:** Common Mistakes & Tips

Type mismatches:
Always ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.

Casting:
In DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.

Reserved Keywords:
Watch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.

Bit indexing:
Is not explicit like other HDLs, and must be done through a static shift operation.
