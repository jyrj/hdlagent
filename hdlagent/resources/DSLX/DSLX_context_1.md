**User:** Introduction to DSLX
Welcome to the world of `DSLX`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.

1. Understanding Basic Data Types
In DSLX, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:

`u1` represents a single bit.
`u3` represents 3 bits.
... and so forth.

Remember:
`u8` is used as a character in DSLX. Example: `let null:u8 = '\0';`
Bit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.

2. Compound Data Types

Tuples and Arrays are your friends:
Tuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.
Arrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;
Tip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.

3. Functions in DSLX

Here's the basic anatomy of a function:
```
fn function_name(input1: type1, input2: type2) -> return_type {
    // Function body
}
```
Important notes:
The return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.
Functions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.

4. Operations and Pitfalls

Operations are intuitive but require care:
Use standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).
When mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.

Explicit Type Extension:
Instead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.
Use concatenation `++` to extend bits. Example: To extend `u1` to `u2`: `let extended_bit: u2 = u1:0 ++ your_bit;`

Avoid Using Reserved Keywords:
In DSLX, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.
Using reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.

5. Structs, Enums, and Testing

Structs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:
Structs are custom data types with fields.
Enums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.
Note: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.

6. Common Mistakes & Tips

Type mismatches:
Always ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.

Casting:
In DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.

Reserved Keywords:
Watch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.

Bit indexing:
Is not explicit like other HDLs, and must be done through a static shift operation.

Conclusion
DSLX offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.
