**User:** Write me a DSLX program named 'nor_reduction' that takes a 8-bit input 'bus_i' and has a 1-bit output 'reduce_o' which is the NOR reduction of 'bus_i'.

**Assistant:** ```dslx
struct NorReductionOutput {
  reduce_o: bits[1],
}

fn nor_reduction(bus_i: bits[8]) -> NorReductionOutput {
  // DSLX does not have any unary operators besides inversion and negation, so each individual bit must first be isolated. Resulting type is bits[] array with one entry
  let or_reduce: bits[1] = bus_i[0:1] | bus_i[1:2] | bus_i[2:3] | bus_i[3:4] | bus_i[4:5] | bus_i[5:6] | bus_i[6:7]  | bus_i[7:8]; // pythonic part-select syntax
  // DSLX does not support mutable variables, so intermediate values are used instead, in this case for unary inversion
  let reduce_o = !or_reduce;
  NorReductionOutput { reduce_o: reduce_o }  // local value name matches struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX program named 'evens_odds_sum' that takes a 7-bit input 'in_i' and has three outputs. 'odds_o' is 3-bits wide and is the odd-numbered bits from the input, concatenated in order. Conversely, 'evens_o' is 4-bits wide and is the even-numbered bits. The last output 'sum_o' is the 4-bit wide sum of 'odds_o' and 'evens_o'.

**Assistant:** ```dslx
struct OutputStruct {
  odds_o: u3,
  evens_o: u4,
  sum_o: u4,
}

fn odds_evens_sum(in_i: u7) -> OutputStruct {
  let odds_o = in_i[5:6] ++ in_i[3:4] ++ in_i[1:2] as u3;  // ++ operator concatenates, typecast to match output struct field type
  let evens_o = (in_i[6:7] ++ in_i[4:5] ++ in_i[2:3] ++ in_i[0:1]) as u4; // typecast to u4 as bits[] doesn't suport arithmetic operations

  let sum_o: u4 = odds_o as u4 + evens_o; // typecast odds_o to u4 as all righthand side types must match each  other and lefthand side type when explicit
  OutputStruct { odds_o: odds_o, evens_o: evens_o, sum_o: sum_o } // local value names match struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX function named 'simple_alu' that implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit which has three inputs: 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i' are both 8-bit wide value inputs, and 'op_i' is a 2-bit wide opcode input, which determines the operation performed on 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i'. The function has a single 8-bit output 'result_o', which is set to the sum of the inputs when the opcode is 0, the difference of the inputs when the opcode is 1, and the product of the inputs when the opcode is 2. No other operations are supported, so if an unknown opcode is detected, the output is set to zero.

**Assistant:** ```dslx
struct OutputStruct {
  result_o: u8,
}

fn simple_alu(rs1_i: u8, rs2_i: u8, op_i: u2) -> OutputStruct {

  // DSLX does not have Verilog/C style ternary operator "?", so nested conditionals are verbose
  // Better practice is pattern matching, which emulates case/switch statements, using "match" keyword
  let result_o: u8 = match op_i {
                       u2:0 => rs1_i + rs2_i,
                       u2:1 => rs1_i - rs2_i,
                       u2:2 => rs1_i * rs2_i,
                       _ => u8:0 // default case
                     };

  OutputStruct { result_o: result_o } // local value names match struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX function that uses a compile loop to add up the values from 7 to 11. The name should be 'add_7_to_11' and has 16-bit output 'res_o'

**Assistant:** ```dslx
struct Outputs {
  result: u16,
}

fn add_7_to_11() -> Outputs {

  // Mutable values not allowed, so an accumulator value 'accum' is modified alongside the iterator 'i'
  let base = u16:7;
  let res = for (i, accum): (u16, u16) in u16:0..u16:4 {
    accum + base + i
  }(u16:0);

  Outputs { result: res }
}
```
