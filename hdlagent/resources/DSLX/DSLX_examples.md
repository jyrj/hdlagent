**User:** Write me a DSLX program named 'nor_reduction' that takes a 8-bit input 'bus_i' and has a 1-bit output 'reduce_o' which is the NOR reduction of 'bus_i'.

**Assistant:** ```
struct NorReductionOutput {
  reduce_o: u1, // unsigned 1-bit int type, sX is for signed X-bit int type
}

fn nor_reduction(bus_i: bits[8]) -> NorReductionOutput {    // takes an input of 8 bits, this is the way to declare an array, best partice is to avoid bits[] and typecast to uX
  // DSLX does not have any unary operators besides inversion and negation, so each individual bit must first be isolated. Resulting type is bits[] array with one entry, aka one bit
  let or_reduce: bits[1] = (bus_i[0:1] as u1) | (bus_i[1:2] as u1) | (bus_i[2:3] as u1) | (bus_i[3:4] as u1) | (bus_i[4:5] as u1) | (bus_i[5:6] as u1) | (bus_i[6:7] as u1) | (bus_i[7:8] as u1); // non-inclusive range pythonic part-select syntax, use 'as' keyword to typecast
  // DSLX does not support mutable variables, so intermediate values are used instead, in this case for unary inversion
  let reduce_o = !or_reduce as u1;  // typecast to 1-bit unsigned int, match output struct type
  NorReductionOutput { reduce_o: reduce_o as u1 }  // local value name matches struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX program named 'evens_odds_sum' that takes a 7-bit input 'in_i' and has three outputs. 'odds_o' is 3-bits wide and is the odd-numbered bits from the input, concatenated in order. Conversely, 'evens_o' is 4-bits wide and is the even-numbered bits. The last output 'sum_o' is the 4-bit wide sum of 'odds_o' and 'evens_o'.

**Assistant:** ```
struct OutputStruct {
  odds_o: u3,
  evens_o: u4,
  sum_o: u4,
}

fn odds_evens_sum(in_i: u7) -> OutputStruct {
  let odds_o = (in_i[5:6] ++ in_i[3:4] ++ in_i[1:2]) as u3;  // ++ operator concatenates, typecast to match output struct field type
  let evens_o = (in_i[6:7] ++ in_i[4:5] ++ in_i[2:3] ++ in_i[0:1]) as u4; // typecast to u4 as bits[] doesn't suport arithmetic operations

  let sum_o: u4 = (odds_o as u4) + evens_o; // typecast odds_o to u4 as all righthand side types must match each  other and lefthand side type when explicit
  OutputStruct { odds_o: odds_o as u3, evens_o: evens_o as u4, sum_o: sum_o as u4} // local value names match struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX function named 'simple_alu' that implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit which has three inputs: 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i' are both 8-bit wide value inputs, and 'op_i' is a 2-bit wide opcode input, which determines the operation performed on 'rs1_i' and 'rs2_i'. The function has a single 8-bit output 'result_o', which is set to the sum of the inputs when the opcode is 0, the difference of the inputs when the opcode is 1, and the product of the inputs when the opcode is 2. No other operations are supported, so if an unknown opcode is detected, the output is set to zero.

**Assistant:** ```
struct OutputStruct {
  result_o: u8,
}

fn simple_alu(rs1_i: u8, rs2_i: u8, op_i: u2) -> OutputStruct {

  // DSLX does NOT have Verilog/C style ternary operator "?", so nested conditionals are verbose
  // Better practice is pattern matching, which emulates case/switch statements, using "match" keyword
  let result_o: u8 = match op_i {
                       u2:0 => rs1_i + rs2_i,
                       u2:1 => rs1_i - rs2_i,
                       u2:2 => rs1_i * rs2_i,
                       _ => u8:0 // default case
                     };

  OutputStruct { result_o: result_o as u8} // local value names match struct field name
}
```

**User:** Write me a DSLX function that uses a compile loop to add up the values from 7 to 11. The name should be 'add_7_to_11' and has 16-bit output 'res_o'

**Assistant:** ```
struct Outputs {
  res_o: u16,
}

fn add_7_to_11() -> Outputs {

  // Mutable values NOT allowed, 'mut' keyword does NOT exist, so an accumulator value 'accum' is modified alongside the iterator 'i'
  let base = u16:7;    // constants must have their type declared, this is a 16-bit unsigned value 7
  let res_o = for (i, accum): (u16, u16) in u16:0..u16:4 {
    accum + base + i
  }(u16:0);

  Outputs { res_o: res_o as u16}
}
``` 

**User:** Write me a DSLX function that is a naive implementation of the RISC-V FMAdd instruction, where the opcode is as listed in the official spec, but any FP rules are ignored as well as the RM and FMT fields. The source operands will take on the values of their register numbers. The 'result' output will be the multiply-add operation, and the 'rd' output will be the decoded destination register. If the opcode is incorrect, then the 'err' output must be set and the other outputs must be cleared. The equivalent Verilog declaration would be 'module fmadd(input [31:0] instruction, output [4:0] rd, output [4:0] result, output err);'

**Assistant:** ```
struct FMAddOutput {
  rd: u5,
  result: u5,
  err: u1,
}

fn fmadd(instruction: u32) -> FMAddOutput {
  let opcode = instruction[0:7] as u7;     // Extract bits 0 to 6
  let rs1 = instruction[15:20] as u5;      // bits 15 to 19
  let rs2 = instruction[20:25] as u5;      // bits 20 to 24
  let rs3 = instruction[27:32] as u5;      // bits 27 to 31

  // sets rd and result to 0 if opcode is wrong
  let err = (opcode != u7:0b1000011) as u1;
  // 'if' is an experssion with a return value, NOT a statement that causes impossible mutations
  let mask = if (err == u1:1) { u5:0b11111 } else { u5:0b00000 };

  let rd = instruction[7:12] as u5 & mask;  // bits 7 to 11 masked
  // LHS type matches RHS type (u5)
  let result = ((rs1 * rs2) + rs3) & mask;

  FMAddOutput { rd: rd, result: result, err: err }
}
```
