Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
You are given a four-bit input vector in[3:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: 
// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3]. 
// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. 
// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left. For example, out_different[2] should indicate if in[2] is different from in[3]. For this part, treat the vector as wrapping around, so in[3]'s neighbour to the left is in[0].The declaration of the module in verilog is: module gatesv (input [3:0] in,output [2:0] out_both,output [3:1] out_any,output [3:0] out_different);
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be gatesv


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module gatesv (
  input [3:0] in,
  output [2:0] out_both,
  output [3:1] out_any,
  output [3:0] out_different
);

  assign out_both[0] = in[0] & in[1];
  assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[2];
  assign out_both[2] = in[2] & in[3];

  assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0];
  assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1];
  assign out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2];

  assign out_different[0] = in[0] ^ in[3];
  assign out_different[1] = in[1] ^ in[0];
  assign out_different[2] = in[2] ^ in[1];
  assign out_different[3] = in[3] ^ in[2];

endmodule
```

Please rewrite the Verilog module in its entirety to match the expected output values of the testbench. And as previously mentioned, return only valid program syntax. No english explanations, except in the form of short comments.

Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be gatesv


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module gatesv (

  output [2:0] out_both,
  output [3:1] out_any,
