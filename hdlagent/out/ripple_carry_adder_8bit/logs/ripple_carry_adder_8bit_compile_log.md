Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design an 8-bit ripple carry adder. you have to design a submodule named fulladder where the inputs are `a`, `b` and `cin`, the outputs are `sum` and `cout`. module `ripple_carry_adder_8bit ` uses the fulladder module and has 3 inputs, 2 8-bit inputs `a`, `b` and one-bit `cin`. 8-bit output sun and obe-bit `cout`
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module ripple_carry_adder_8bit(input  [7:0] a,input  [7:0] b,input  [0:0] cin,output  [7:0] sum,output  [0:0] cout);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module fulladder(input a, input b, input cin, output sum, output cout);
    assign {cout, sum} = a + b + cin;
endmodule

module ripple_carry_adder_8bit(input [7:0] a, input [7:0] b, input [0:0] cin, output [7:0] sum, output [0:0] cout);
    wire [7:0] cout_temp;
    fulladder fa0(a[0], b[0], cin, sum[0], cout_temp[0]);
    fulladder fa1(a[1], b[1], cout_temp[0], sum[1], cout_temp[1]);
    // Repeat for fa2 to fa6
    fulladder fa7(a[7], b[7], cout_temp[6], sum[7], cout);
