# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a module that combines multiple bitwise operations. Inputs: [7:0]a, [7:0]b. Outputs: [7:0]o. The module should take two 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and produce an 8-bit output 'o' that is the result of '(a AND b) XOR (a OR b)'.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be combined_operations


**Assistant:**
module combined_operations (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] o
);
    
always @* begin
    o = (a & b) ^ (a | b);
end

endmodule

**System:**
Success!
