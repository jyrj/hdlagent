**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Create a module with input: [3:0]a and output: [1:0]count that counts the number of '1's in a 4-bit input and outputs a 2-bit result.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be count_ones


**Assistant:**
module count_ones (
    input [3:0] a,
    output [1:0] count
);

assign count = {a[3] + a[2], a[1] + a[0]};

endmodule

Please rewrite the Verilog module in its entirety to match the expected output values of the testbench. And as previously mentioned, return only valid program syntax. No english explanations, except in the form of short comments.
