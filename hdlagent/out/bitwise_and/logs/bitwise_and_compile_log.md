# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Implement a module that computes the bitwise AND operation. Inputs: [7:0]a, [7:0]b. Outputs: [7:0]o.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be bitwise_and


**Assistant:**
module bitwise_and (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] o
);
    always @* begin
        o = a & b;
    end
endmodule

**System:**
Success!
