# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a module that performs a NOR reduction on its 8 bit input bus 'reduce_i'. The output is named 'result_o' and should be one bit as it is the NOR of each bit of 'reduce_i'. Input(s): reduce_i[7:0]. Output(s): result_o[0].
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module nor_reduction(input  [7:0] reduce_i,output  [0:0] result_o);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module nor_reduction(
  input [7:0] reduce_i,
  output [0:0] result_o
);
  assign result_o = ~(|reduce_i);
endmodule
```

**System:**
Success!
