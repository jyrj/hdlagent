# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Create a module that uses a hexadecimal literal to set a 16-bit output 'o' set to value 0xA55A.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be hex_literal_demo


**Assistant:**
module hex_literal_demo (
    output reg [15:0] o
);

assign o = 16'hA55A;

endmodule

**System:**
