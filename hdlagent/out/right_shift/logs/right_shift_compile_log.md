Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Implement a module that shifts bits right by three positions. Inputs: [7:0]a. Outputs: [7:0]o.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be right_shift


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module right_shift (
    input [7:0] a,
    output [7:0] o
);

assign o = {a[2:0], 5'b0};

endmodule
```
