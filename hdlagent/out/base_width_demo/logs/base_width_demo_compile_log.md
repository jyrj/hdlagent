# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a module that showcases the use of both base and width specifiers for a constant. Use the value to set an 8-bit output 'o' to be 170 in decimal.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be base_width_demo


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module base_width_demo (
    output reg [7:0] o
);

localparam logic [7:0] constant_value = 8'd170;

always @* begin
    o = constant_value;
end

endmodule
```

**System:**
Success!
