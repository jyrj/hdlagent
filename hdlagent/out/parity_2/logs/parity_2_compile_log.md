Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a circuit to convert 4-bit binary input into even and odd parity .Problem Requirements: Design the circuit in such a way that it accepts a 4-bit binary as an input (`abcd`). The circuit will generate two outputs, even parity bit (`P1`) and odd parity bit (`P2`).
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module parity_2(input  [3:0] abcd,output  [0:0] P1,output  [0:0] P2);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module parity_2(
  input  [3:0] abcd,
  output [0:0] P1,
  output [0:0] P2
);

// Combinational logic for even parity
assign P1 = abcd[0] ^ abcd[1] ^ abcd[2] ^ abcd[3];

// Combinational logic for odd parity
assign P2 = ~ (abcd[0] & abcd[1] & abcd[2] & abcd[3]);

endmodule
```
