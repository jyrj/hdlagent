# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a module that shifts bits left by two positions. Inputs: [7:0]a. Outputs: [7:0]o.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be left_shift


**Assistant:**
module left_shift(
  input [7:0] a,
  output [7:0] o
);

  assign o = {a[1:0], a[7:2]};

endmodule

Please rewrite the Verilog module in its entirety to match the expected output values of the testbench. And as previously mentioned, return only valid program syntax. No english explanations, except in the form of short comments.

Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
