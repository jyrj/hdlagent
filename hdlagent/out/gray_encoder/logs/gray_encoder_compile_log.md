**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a 4-bit binary to gray-code encoder. Each time the binary inputs change, the corresponding gray code output should be displayed. It has a 4-bit `binary_input` and a 4-bit `gray_code`.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module gray_encoder(input  [3:0] binary_input,output  [3:0] gray_code);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module gray_encoder(
    input [3:0] binary_input,
    output [3:0] gray_code
);

assign gray_code[0] = binary_input[0];
assign gray_code[1] = binary_input[0] ^ binary_input[1];
assign gray_code[2] = binary_input[1] ^ binary_input[2];
assign gray_code[3] = binary_input[2] ^ binary_input[3];

endmodule
```
