# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Create a module that utilizes a for loop to find the sum of each bit of input 'data'. Inputs: [7:0]data. Outputs: [3:0]sum.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be vector_sum


**Assistant:**
module vector_sum (
    input [7:0] data,
    output reg [3:0] sum
);

always @* begin
    sum = 4'b0;
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        sum = sum + data[i];
    end
end

endmodule

Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
The previous module failed some test cases of the desired implementation, here are some of the results:
out/vector_sum/vector_sum.v:8: ERROR: Left hand side of 1st expression of procedural for-loop is not a register!

Please rewrite the Verilog module in its entirety to match the expected output values of the testbench. And as previously mentioned, return only valid program syntax. No english explanations, except in the form of short comments.
