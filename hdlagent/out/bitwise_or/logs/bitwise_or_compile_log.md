# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a module that calculates the bitwise OR operation. Inputs: [7:0]a, [7:0]b. Outputs: [7:0]o.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The name of the module should be bitwise_or


**Assistant:**
module bitwise_or (
  input [7:0] a,
  input [7:0] b,
  output [7:0] o
);

assign o = a | b;

endmodule


**System:**
Success!
