# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Please implement the `neuron_block` module, define a module with a set of 8-bit inputs for the neuron's parameters, including current potential (`voltage_potential_i`), thresholds (`pos_threshold_i`, `neg_threshold_i`), leak value (`leak_value_i`), weights (`weight_type1_i` to `weight_type4_i`), weight selector (`weight_select_i`), resets (`pos_reset_i`, `neg_reset_i`), and an enable signal (`enable_i`). The module should have an 8-bit output `new_potential_o` for the updated potential and a binary output `spike_o` to indicate spiking. Use combinational logic to select the weight based on `weight_select_i` and calculate the new potential by adding the selected weight to the current potential and subtracting the leak value, taking care to manage overflow and underflow. Check if the new potential crosses any thresholds to determine spiking behavior and potential resets. Ensure the neuron only updates when enabled, and resets its outputs when not enabled. Inputs: The module should have several 8-bit inputs, each representing different parameters of the neuron: `voltage_potential_i`: The current voltage potential of the neuron. `pos_threshold_i`: The positive threshold voltage at which the neuron fires a spike. `neg_threshold_i`: The negative threshold voltage at which the neuron might inhibit firing. `leak_value_i`: The value representing the neuron's leakage, reducing its potential over time. `weight_type1_i` to `weight_type4_i`: Four different types of synaptic weights that can be applied to the input signal. `weight_select_i`: A selector for choosing which of the four weight types to apply. `pos_reset_i`: The voltage potential to reset to after a positive spike. `neg_reset_i`: The voltage potential to reset to after dropping below the negative threshold. `enable_i`: An enable signal that allows the neuron to update its state. Outputs: `new_potential_o`: The updated voltage potential of the neuron. `spike_o`: A binary output indicating whether the neuron has fired a spike.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module neuron_block(input  [7:0] voltage_potential_i,input  [7:0] pos_threshold_i,input  [7:0] neg_threshold_i,input  [7:0] leak_value_i,input  [7:0] weight_type1_i,input  [7:0] weight_type2_i,input  [7:0] weight_type3_i,input  [7:0] weight_type4_i,input  [7:0] weight_select_i,input  [7:0] pos_reset_i,input  [7:0] neg_reset_i,input  [0:0] enable_i,output  [0:0] reg [7:0] new_potential_o,output  [0:0] reg spike_o);
