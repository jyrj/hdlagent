# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a 4:1 Multiplexer, the inputs are a 4-bit `a` and 2-bit `s` and the output is 1-bit `y` .A multiplexer, also known as MUX, is a combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of the many input lines and directs it to a single output line. The selection of a particular input line is controlled by a set of selection lines. 

Here, the task is to design a 4:1 MUX which has four input lines, two selection lines, and one output line. The output line depends on the input selected by the selection line.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module mux4to1_b(input  [3:0] a,input  [1:0] s,output  [0:0] reg y);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module mux4to1_b(
  input  [3:0] a,
  input  [1:0] s,
  output  reg [0:0] y
);

always @(*)
begin
  case(s)
    2'b00: y = a[0];
    2'b01: y = a[1];
    2'b10: y = a[2];
    2'b11: y = a[3];
  endcase
end

endmodule
```
