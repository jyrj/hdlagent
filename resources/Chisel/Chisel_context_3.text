I have been writing some Chisel code lately and I have come across a lot of syntax errors, let me show you what errors I have seen and how to avoid them.

ERROR example 1:
```
example.scala:38:13: not found: value Cat
io.result_o := Cat(io.a_i, io.b_i)
               ^
```

SOLUTION example 1:
Common utilities such as Cat() in Chisel are dependent upon importing the standard library. It is best practice to always include the following line in all Chisel files written.
Fix:
```
import chisel3.util._
```

ERROR example 2:
```
example.scala:12:3: not found: value switch
switch(io.a) {
^
example.scala:13:5: not found: value is
is(0.U) { io.out := "b0001".U }
^
```

SOLUTION example 2:
Same issue as with Cat(), is that switch/case statements depend on importing the standard library. It is best practice to always "import chisel3.util._"
Fix:
```
import chisel3.util._
```

ERROR example 3:
```
example:14:12: not found: value PopCount
io.P2 := PopCount(io.abcd) % 2.U === 0.U
         ^
```

SOLUTION example 3:
Same issue as with Cat() and switch/case, is that Chisel files are dependent on importing the standard library. It is best practice to always include the following line in all Chisel files written.
Fix:
```
import chisel3.util._
```

ERROR example 4:
```
example.scala:10:34: no arguments allowed for nullary macro method unary_~: ()chisel3.Bits
io.out := (~io.in.xorR)(0)
                        ^
```

SOLUTION example 4:
Unary operators and methods return values are type Boolean, so one cannot perform bit indexing.
Fix:
```
io.out := (~io.in.xorR)
```

ERROR example 5:
```
example.scala:14:57: type mismatch;
found   : Int
required: chisel3.UInt
when(io.a >= (io.b << (7.U - i))) {                                                  
                             ^
```

SOLUTION example 5:
Chisel is built on top of Scala, so oftentimes the two languages type systems may conflict.
Issues arise when Scala types are assigned to Chisel values, which is a problem as Chisel datatypes are used to specify the type of values held in state elements or flowing on wires. A common place for such conflicts is in the case of for loops, where an iteration variable is by default a Scala Int, but may be used as a Chisel value, which needs to be a UInt or SInt. Values can be typecast to conform to Chisels typesystem.
Fix:
```
when(io.a >= (io.b << (7.U - i.asUInt()))) {
```
