The classic ripple-carry adder -- this function generates a ripple carry adder of abitrary length including both carry in and carry out. The full adder ("fa") takes 1-bit inputs and produces 1-bit outputs. We iteratively generate full adders and link the carry in of each new adder to the carry out of the prior. A Python dictionary keeps track of the wires carrying the sum bits as we iterate through. The final sum is then just the concatenation of the wires in that dictionary.
***`Clock` signals should never be explicit in PyRTL
```
from pyrtl import *
def fa(x, y, cin):
    sum = x ^ y ^ cin
    cout = x&y | y&cin | x&cin
    return sum, cout

# An n-bit ripple carry adder with carry in and carry out
def adder(a, b, cin):
    a, b = match_bitwidth(a, b)
    n = len(a)

    sum = {}
    for i in range(n):
        sum[i], cout = fa(a[i], b[i], cin)
        cin = cout
    full_sum = concat_list([sum[i] for i in range(n)])
    return full_sum, cout
```

Mul generates a small 4 x 4 multiplier with a simple table lookup. The first line simple checks that the inputs are each 4-bits wide. The next is a Python function that gives us the values we want stored in the ROM as a function of the address. The ROM is automatically initialized with that function. The final hardware generated simply concatenates the two 4-bit inputs into an single 8-bit address and returns the value at that ROM address.
```
from pyrtl import *

def mul(x, y):
    assert(len(x) == 4 and len(y) == 4)
    romdata = lambda addr: (addr >> 4) * (addr & 0xf)
    tbl = RomBlock(8, 8, romdata)
    return tbl[concat(x,y)]
```

Question: how to convert a PyRTL code to verilog?
Answer:
Design your circuit using PyRTL: Before you can convert to Verilog, you must have a valid PyRTL design. PyRTL provides a high-level syntax to describe digital circuits, so you'll be using Python to define inputs, outputs, wires, and the connections between them.
```
import pyrtl

# Define inputs
a = pyrtl.Input(8, 'a')
b = pyrtl.Input(8, 'b')

# Output with the combined operations
o = pyrtl.Output(8, 'o')

# Define the required operation
o <<= (a & b) ^ (a | b)
```
Convert the PyRTL design to Verilog: Once your PyRTL design is ready, you can use the output_to_verilog() function from PyRTL to generate the corresponding Verilog code.

As per the error you previously encountered, you should provide a file object to the output_to_verilog() function. Here's how to do that:
```
# Convert to Verilog
output_filename = 'output.v'
with open(output_filename, 'w') as f:
    pyrtl.output_to_verilog(f)
```
This code writes the Verilog translation of your PyRTL design to a file named output.v.;

Question: If resets are implicit, then how do I specify an asyncronous reset?
Answer: the .output_to_verilog() method has an optional parameter 'add_reset' where one can specify an asyncornous reset logic by passing in the string "asynchronous" as the argument: 'add_reset='asynchronous''.
```
with open(output_filename, 'w') as f:
    pyrtl.output_to_verilog(f, add_reset='asynchronous')
```
