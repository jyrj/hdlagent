When ever you got this ERROR:
```
 File "/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyrtl/wire.py", line 414, in __getitem__
    raise PyrtlError(\'selection %s must have at least one selected wire\' % str(item))
pyrtl.pyrtlexceptions.PyrtlError: selection slice(3, 0, None) must have at least one selected wire
```
SOLUTION:
The error message you're encountering in PyRTL, PyrtlError: selection slice(3, 0, None) must have at least one selected wire, typically occurs when you're trying to slice a wire or a register, but the slice is improperly defined.

1. Check Slice Indices: Ensure that the start index is less than or equal to the end index. In PyRTL, unlike standard Python slicing, both the start and the end indices are inclusive. For example, some_wire[3:0] would be a valid slice if some_wire has at least 4 bits.

2. Ensure Non-Empty Slice: Make sure your slice actually includes at least one bit. If the start index is greater than the end index, you'll end up with an empty slice, which is not valid. For instance, some_wire[0:3] is correct for a 4-bit wire, but some_wire[3:0] would be incorrect and lead to an empty slice.
3. Check Bitwidth: Verify that the wire or register you are trying to slice has a sufficient number of bits to accommodate your slicing request. For example, if you try to slice the first four bits [3:0] of a 3-bit wire, you'll get an error.
4. Use Individual Bit Selection: If slicing is still causing issues, consider accessing individual bits and concatenating them manually. For instance, instead of some_wire[3:0], you could use pyrtl.concat(some_wire[3], some_wire[2], some_wire[1], some_wire[0]).


ERROR example:
```
data_i = pyrtl.Input(bitwidth=1, name='data_i')
shift_reg = pyrtl.Register(bitwidth=5, name='shift_reg')
# Describe the behavior of the shift register on clock edge
next_val = pyrtl.concat(shift_reg[3:0], data_i)  # shifted left, new data on the right # **************This will cause an ERROR
```
Solution: Correcting the Code
```
data_i = pyrtl.Input(bitwidth=1, name='data_i')
shift_reg = pyrtl.Register(bitwidth=5, name='shift_reg')
# Describe the behavior of the shift register on clock edge
next_val = pyrtl.concat(shift_reg[3], shift_reg[2], shift_reg[1], shift_reg[0], data_i) # SOLUTION
```
