Here is a `tiny_adder` function in DSLX which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it:  ```

// Returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit.
fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2 {
  let lhs = x as u2;
  let rhs = y as u2;
  lhs + rhs
}

#[test]
fn test_exhaustive() {
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:0), u2:0b00);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:1), u2:0b01);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:1), u2:0b10);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:0), u2:0b01);
}```"""

DSLX_response_1 = """Great introduction! For those unfamiliar with hardware description languages (HDLs) or coming from other HDLs like VHDL or Verilog, DSLX can be a refreshing experience. It offers a blend of software-like syntax and the precision needed to describe hardware.

To further enhance your tutorial, you might consider adding the following:

    Examples: Use practical examples to demonstrate the use of the language constructs. This will provide a hands-on experience to the reader and make it easier to grasp concepts.

    Interoperability: Highlight if DSLX offers interoperability features with other hardware description languages. This can be useful for those transitioning from other HDLs.

    Comparison with other HDLs: It can be beneficial to compare DSLX to other popular HDLs, highlighting its advantages and potential downsides. This can help readers decide if DSLX is the right choice for their projects.

    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) & Tools: A brief mention of any recommended tools, simulators, or IDEs that work well with DSLX can be invaluable for beginners.

    Community & Support: Point out resources like forums, online communities, or official documentation where readers can seek help, share their projects, or learn more.

    Advanced Features: Introduce a few advanced features or best practices for readers who may want to dive deeper into DSLX after grasping the basics.

    Use Cases: Highlight some common or innovative use cases for DSLX. This could include specific industries, applications, or types of projects where DSLX shines.

Lastly, a hands-on workshop or interactive online platform where learners can practice DSLX could be an invaluable resource. Direct engagement with the language and immediate feedback can significantly accelerate the learning process.
