Title: Combinational Logic in Verilog

- Logical Operators: Explanation and examples of logical operators like &&, ||, and !.
  - Example 1: `assign out = (a && b) || c;` (Logical AND and OR)
  - Example 2: `assign out = !a;` (Logical NOT)
- Bitwise Operations: Detailed use of bitwise operators & , | , ^ , ~.
  - Example 1: `assign out = a & b;` (Bitwise AND)
  - Example 2: `assign out = a | b;` (Bitwise OR)
- Conditional Expressions: Using the ternary operator ?: for conditional assignments.
  - Example 1: `assign out = (a > b) ? a : b;` (Select larger of a or b)
  - Example 2: `assign led = (error) ? red : green;` (Error indication)
- Concatenation and Replication: Using {} for concatenating and replicating signals.
  - Example 1: `assign bus = {a, b, c, d};` (Concatenation)
  - Example 2: `assign bus = {4{a}};` (Replication)
- Karnaugh Maps and Boolean Algebra: Basics of optimizing logic expressions.
  - Example 1: Simplification of logic functions.
  - Example 2: Implementing optimized logic circuits.

- Basic Syntax:
  - Statements and Terminators: Verilog uses semicolons to terminate statements.
    - Example: `assign sum = a + b;`
  - Comments: Single-line (`//`) and block comments (`/* ... */`).
    - Example: `// This is a single-line comment`
- Data Types:
  - Primitive Types: Mainly `wire`, `reg`, `integer`, `real`.
    - Example: `integer count;`
  - Basic String Operations: Verilog has limited string capabilities.
    - Example: `initial $display("The count is %d", count);`


Nested Loops in Verilog:

1. Purpose: 
   - Nested loops are used in testbenches, hardware generation, and initializing structures in simulation.

2. Types of Loops:
   - For loop: Commonly used for a fixed number of iterations.
   - While and Repeat loops: Used for condition-based iterations.

3. Example Uses:
   - Generating Test Patterns: Applying a range of test vectors in testbenches.
   - Creating Hardware Structures: Such as logic gates matrices or connection networks.

4. Syntax:
   - Basic syntax: `for (initialization; condition; increment) { ... }`

5. Examples:

   - Simple Nested Loop Example:
     ```
     integer i, j;
     initial begin
       for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) begin
         for (j = 0; j < 5; j = j + 1) begin
           $display("i=%d, j=%d", i, j);
         end
       end
     end
     ```
     This prints pairs of `i` and `j`, iterating through a 10x5 grid.

   - Hardware Generation Example:
     ```
     genvar i, j;
     generate
       for (i = 0; i < N; i = i + 1) begin : row
         for (j = 0; j < M; j = j + 1) begin : col
           and gate_inst (out[i][j], a[i], b[j]);
         end
       end
     endgenerate
     ```
     Creates an NxM grid of AND gates with inputs `a[i]` and `b[j]`.
